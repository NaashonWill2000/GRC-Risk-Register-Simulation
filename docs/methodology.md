# Risk Assessment Methodology

This document outlines the methodology used to identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks for the simulated small business environment.

## 1. Risk Identification

Risks were identified by reviewing the business’s:
- Core assets
- Business processes
- Technology environment
- Regulatory obligations
- Previous incidents (industry-wide)
- Operational dependencies

Each risk was categorized as **technical**, **operational**, **physical**, or **administrative**.

## 2. Likelihood Scale (1–5)

| Score | Likelihood Level | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **1** | Rare | Highly unlikely to occur; has never happened before. |
| **2** | Unlikely | Low probability; may occur under specific conditions. |
| **3** | Possible | Could occur occasionally; reasonable chance. |
| **4** | Likely | Has occurred before; expected to happen again. |
| **5** | Almost Certain | High frequency; expected in the near term without controls. |

## 3. Impact Scale (1–5)

Impact is assessed based on consequences to:
- Financial loss
- Customer trust and reputation
- Legal or regulatory exposure
- Business operations
- Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data

| Score | Impact Level | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **1** | Negligible | Minimal disruption, no significant harm. |
| **2** | Minor | Small operational inconvenience, low cost to recover. |
| **3** | Moderate | Noticeable disruption; short-term operational or financial impacts. |
| **4** | Major | Severe business interruption; large financial or compliance consequences. |
| **5** | Critical | Business-critical failure; legal liabilities, major data breach, or long-term damage. |

## 4. Risk Scoring Formula

All risks are scored using the standard formula:

`Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact`
